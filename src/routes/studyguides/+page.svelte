				Please submit any study guides you have created to receive "other" credits. Each study guide
				can receive up to 1 credit, depending on the quality. Please note that this year, we are
				encouraging submissions of all formats, including Quizlets, Kahoots, handwritten notes, and
				more. We hope that offering a wider range of formats will support all students with varying
				learning styles.
